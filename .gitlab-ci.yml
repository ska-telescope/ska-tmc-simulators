# GitLab CI in conjunction with GitLab Runner can use Docker Engine to test and build any application.
# Docker, when used with GitLab CI, runs each job in a separate and isolated container using the predefined image that is set up in .gitlab-ci.yml.
# In this case we use the latest python docker image to build and test this project.

# The YAML file defines a set of jobs with constraints stating when they should be run.
# You can specify an unlimited number of jobs which are defined as top-level elements with an arbitrary name and always have to contain at least the script clause.
# In this case we have only the test job which produce an artifacts (it must be placed into a directory called "public")
# It is also specified that only the master branch will be subject of this job.
