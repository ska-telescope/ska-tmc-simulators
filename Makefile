# Project makefile for a ska-tmc-simulators project. You should normally only need to modify
# PROJECT below.
#
#
# CAR_OCI_REGISTRY_HOST and PROJECT are combined to define
# the Docker tag for this project. The definition below inherits the standard
# value for CAR_OCI_REGISTRY_HOST (=artefact.skao.int) and overwrites
# PROJECT to give a final Docker tag of 
# artefact.skao.int/ska-telescope/ska-tmc-simulators

CAR_OCI_REGISTRY_HOST ?= artefact.skao.int
CAR_OCI_REGISTRY_USER ?= ska-telescope
PROJECT = ska-tmc-simulators

#
# include makefile to pick up the standard Make targets, e.g., 'make build'
# build, 'make push' docker push procedure, etc. The other Make targets
# ('make interactive', 'make test', etc.) are defined in this file.
